# Flash Card

A small learning-aid app: flash cards. Python 3 backend (planned); data and frontend TBD (e.g. SQLite, HTML/CSS or CLI). Right now the repo is in a structure-and-docs phase: we have topic decks as JSON in `topics/`, project rules and an AI spec in `docs/` and `.cursor/rules/`, and no venv or runnable app yet.

**Version:** 0.1.0 (pre-alpha)  
**Author:** (add your name)

For project context, layout, and conventions, see [docs/AI-SPEC.md](docs/AI-SPEC.md).
